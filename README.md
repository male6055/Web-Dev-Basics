# Web-Dev-Basics
Last summers I started doing Web Development. This repository contains basic web development examples and practice files. It includes demonstrations of div creation, event handling, and effects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ideal for beginners looking to understand the fundamentals of frontend development.

# DIV
In this, I learned how to make divs and their uses, how to set their background and all other related stuff.

# converter
I made a simple calculator/converter using Js and Html. I have added some event listeners to ensure dynamic calculation based on the user input.

# Navigation Bar
I learned what is a Nav Bar and how it is made. I have made a simple but beautiful nav bar of a clothing brand.

# Click Events
To understand the basic functions which can be performed via clicks I made a simple frontend in which the background color changes when the user clicks on particular color.
